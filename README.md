Hough Transform
===============

This project provides a C++ implementation of the classical Hough transform and a report which discusses its theory and implementation.

It is structured as follows:
 - report: Directory containing the report pdf as well as the files required to create it
 - source: Directory containing the source and build files
 - bin: Directory containing prebuilt binaries

Building the Project
--------------------

Building the project requires CMake 3.3 or later, as well as recent versions of both OpenCV2 and Armadillo.
The prebuilt binaries expect a Fedora-like distribution of shared libraries.

Running the Program
-------------------

Passing the flag `-h` to the executable should provide enough information to get started. For brevity that information is not reproduced here.
