\section*{Abstract}
The classical Hough transform provides a convenient technique for detecting lines in an image.
A thresholded edge matrix is generated for the image (using any one of a number of edge detection
operators, e.g. the Sobel operator); this matrix is then used in a voting process carried
out in a parameter space. In the classical Hough transform this parameter space is the polar
normal form of a line, which is especially useful as it allows for the constrained
search space $\theta \in (-\pi,\pi]$ as well as for representation of vertical lines.
This paper presents a multithreaded implementation of the classical Hough transform, which assigns
each thread a sub-interval of the search space. Due to the partitioning of the vote accumulation
matrix, each thread can operate on this sub-interval without synchronization, resulting in a dramatic
performance increase on dense inputs.

\section{Introduction}
In the generalized (as well as classical) Hough transform, an edge matrix is generated
for the input image through two-dimensional image convolution. In practice, a variety of image
kernels are used for this convolution, including the Sobel, Scharr and Prewitt operators.
The edge matrix is then thresholded, producing a set of non-zero coordinate pairs.
These coordinate pairs are the input to the accumulation procedure used to detect prominent
features -- which, in the case of the classical Hough transform, are lines.
\\
In the classical Hough transform, the parameter space used for vote accumulation represents
the polar normal form of a line, which is given by $\rho=x*\cos{\theta}+y*\sin{\theta}$.
It has several advantages over the traditional point-slope equations, namely that the search
space is bounded. In the traditional point-slope form, the slope may approach both positive 
and negative infinity; the representation of vertical lines requires this.
